## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

I developed this machine learning model to get a prediction of diabetes. I did it to improve my skills and to become a better programmer. I hope this project can help me be a better programmer and get me a fucking good job, real job. I don't expect that this is gonna help other people. But if this helps, well lucky you! No need to thank me! I am glad that this little work can help me and other people.
